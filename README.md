##Version v0.0.1

**v0.0.0** - Fully functional and working, binary classification for over or under 18 implemented. Modularised successfuly as well.

**v0.0.1** - Object oriented implementation of ```bin_class```

##Future Versions (Planned)

**v0.1.0** - Implemented categorical classification using softmax.

**v0.1.1** - Customisable activations and activation derivatives.

**v0.2.0** - Implement L2/Frobenius, augment data.

**v0.2.1** - Implement optional stochastic/minibatch gradient descent.

**v1.0** - *Maybe* slightly optimistic, but do something with a CNN.
