## Goals for Future Versions


**v0.0.0** - Fully functional and working, binary classification for over or under 18 implemented. Modularised successfuly as well.

**v0.0.1** - Object oriented implementation of ```bin_class```

**v0.0.2** - Stochastic gradient descent implemented

**v0.1.0** - Implemented categorical classification using softmax.

**v0.1.1** - Customisable activations and activation derivatives.

**v0.1.2** - Add Adam optimiser.

**v1.0** - *Maybe* slightly optimistic, but do something with a CNN.
